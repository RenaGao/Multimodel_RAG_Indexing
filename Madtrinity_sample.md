Caption: The image is a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral hemispheres, ventricles, and subarachnoid spaces without any medical devices visible. The region of interest, located centrally and in the middle of the image, exhibits an area of increased density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which is indicative of an intracranial hemorrhage. This abnormality is likely affecting the surrounding brain structures due to mass effect or increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to a shift of brain tissue and potential further complications.

Caption: The image is a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral structures without the use of contrast media. The region of interest, located centrally and in the lower-middle area of the brain, occupies approximately 4.1% of the image area and appears to have a different density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which may indicate an abnormality such as a hemorrhage. This region's unusual appearance, potentially representing a subdural hemorrhage, is situated near critical brain structures, which could suggest a relationship where the hemorrhage may exert pressure on or cause displacement of these adjacent areas.

Caption: The image is a non-contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral hemispheres, ventricular system, and other intracranial structures. The region of interest, located centrally and in the upper-middle area of the brain, occupies approximately 0.6% of the image area and appears to have a different density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which may indicate a pathological change such as a hemorrhage. This abnormal area is likely related to the surrounding brain tissue, potentially representing an area of bleeding that could be exerting pressure on adjacent structures or could be a result of a localized vascular issue within the brain.
