Caption: The image is a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral hemispheres, ventricles, and subarachnoid spaces without any medical devices visible. The region of interest, located centrally and in the middle of the image, exhibits an area of increased density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which is indicative of an intracranial hemorrhage. This abnormality is likely affecting the surrounding brain structures due to mass effect or increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to a shift of brain tissue and potential further complications.

Caption: The image is a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral structures without the use of contrast media. The region of interest, located centrally and in the lower-middle area of the brain, occupies approximately 4.1% of the image area and appears to have a different density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which may indicate an abnormality such as a hemorrhage. This region's unusual appearance, potentially representing a subdural hemorrhage, is situated near critical brain structures, which could suggest a relationship where the hemorrhage may exert pressure on or cause displacement of these adjacent areas.

Caption: The image is a non-contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, showing the cerebral hemispheres, ventricular system, and other intracranial structures. The region of interest, located centrally and in the upper-middle area of the brain, occupies approximately 0.6% of the image area and appears to have a different density compared to the surrounding brain tissue, which may indicate a pathological change such as a hemorrhage. This abnormal area is likely related to the surrounding brain tissue, potentially representing an area of bleeding that could be exerting pressure on adjacent structures or could be a result of a localized vascular issue within the brain.

Caption: The image is a histological slide showing gastric tissue with marked atrophy and disappearance of gastric glands, indicative of intestinal metaplasia. The region of interest is located horizontally on the left and vertically at the bottom, occupying an area ratio of 1.3%. This region shows a significant reduction in gastric glands and the presence of goblet cells, which are not typically found in gastric tissue. The content in the region of interest suggests a pathological change that is likely affecting the surrounding gastric tissue, indicating a progression of intestinal metaplasia.

Caption: The image consists of two photomicrographs showing adipose tissue. The left photomicrograph displays a general view of adipose tissue with numerous adipocytes, characterized by large, clear vacuoles and peripheral nuclei. The right photomicrograph includes an inset that provides a close-up view of a typical lipoblast with multivacuolated cytoplasm indenting the atypical nucleus. The region of interest is located at the bottom right of the right photomicrograph, occupying approximately 0.6% of the area. This region shows atypical cells with multivacuolated cytoplasm and indented nuclei, indicative of a pathological condition. The content in the region of interest suggests the presence of lipoblasts, which may indicate a liposarcoma, and this abnormality is likely affecting the surrounding adipose tissue.
